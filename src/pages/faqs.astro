  {
    question: 'What is this site?',
    answer: 'This is an <strong>unofficial, community-built tool</strong> for exploring Gousto\'s huge library of recipes. It\'s designed to be faster, easier, and more fun than scrolling through the official site when you\'re just looking for cooking ideas.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I search for recipes?',
    answer: 'Just head over to the <a class="font-normal  text-primary-600" href="/search/">Search</a> page and type in a keyword like “chicken,” “vegan,” or “30 minute” and hit enter. You can also browse by <strong>category</strong>, <strong>cuisine</strong>, or just scroll through the recipes at your leisure. It\'s like a recipe box with a built-in filter.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I order these meals?',
    answer: 'Nope, this site is just for browsing. To order meal kits, you\'ll still need to <a class="font-normal  text-primary-600" href="/signup">visit Gousto</a>. We\'re not affiliated with Gousto, so we don\'t handle any ordering or subscriptions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where do the recipes come from?',
    answer: 'All recipe content is sourced from <strong>Gousto\'s publicly available recipes</strong>. We don\'t modify the recipes, we just make them easier to search and explore. Full credit goes to Gousto for the delicious ideas.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I suggest a feature or report a bug?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! This is an ongoing passion project and we love hearing from users. You can email us at <a class="font-normal  text-primary-600" href="mailto:ideas@gousto.wiki">ideas@gousto.wiki</a> with feedback, suggestions, or bug reports.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you use cookies?',
    answer: 'Yes, but not the edible kind. We use basic cookies (via Google Analytics) to understand how the site is used. You can read more on our <a class="font-normal  text-primary-600" href="/cookies/">Cookies</a> and <a class="font-normal  text-primary-600" href="/privacy/">Privacy</a> pages.',
