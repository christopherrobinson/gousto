### Tips for One-Pot Success

*   **Choose the Right Pot:** A large, heavy-bottomed pot, Dutch oven, or deep skillet is ideal for most one-pot meals.
*   **Layering Matters:** Follow the recipe's layering instructions carefully, especially for dishes with pasta or rice, to ensure even cooking.
*   **Don't Peek Too Much:** Resist the urge to lift the lid constantly, as this releases steam and can affect cooking times.
