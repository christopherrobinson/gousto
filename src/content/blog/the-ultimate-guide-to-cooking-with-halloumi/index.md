Halloumi, the iconic semi-hard, unripened brining cheese from Cyprus, has become a global sensation, and for good reason. Traditionally made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk, its unique, layered texture and salty, tangy flavour are unmistakable.

But what truly sets it apart is its high melting point, a quality that makes it a superstar in the kitchen. Instead of turning into a gooey mess, halloumi holds its shape when heated, allowing it to be grilled, fried, or baked to crispy, golden-brown perfection.

Whether you're a seasoned halloumi lover or a curious newcomer, this guide will help you master the art of cooking it, featuring five must-try Gousto recipes that showcase its incredible versatility.

### Our Top Tips for Perfect Halloumi Every Time

Unlock the best flavour and texture from your cheese with these simple tips.

*   **Pat It Dry:** Before you start, always pat your halloumi slices dry with a paper towel. This removes excess brine and is crucial for achieving that perfect golden-brown crust.
*   **Slice it Right:** Aim for slices about 1cm (or half an inch) thick. If it's too thin, it might overcook or fall apart; too thick, and the inside won't get beautifully warm and soft.
*   **Go for Dry Heat:** You don't need oil! A hot, dry non-stick pan or a preheated grill is your best friend. The cheese will release its own fat as it cooks, creating a naturally non-stick surface.
*   **Don't Overcrowd the Pan:** Cook in batches if you need to. Giving the slices space ensures they fry or grill rather than steam, which is the key to getting that signature squeaky-yet-soft texture.
