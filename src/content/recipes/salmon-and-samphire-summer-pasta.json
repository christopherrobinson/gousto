  "description": "In this dish, we're showcasing samphire- a beautiful sea vegetable that grows on beaches. It has a naturally salty flavour and crunchy texture that works beautifully with fish. You'll sprinkle this salmon pasta with a hazelnut 'dukkah', a seasoning made from toasted nuts, sesame seeds and spices for a rich, tasty topping!",
