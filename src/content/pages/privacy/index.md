Just like a good recipe, your trust is built on transparency. This site was created for food lovers, not data collectors, so we only gather the minimum information needed to make things run smoothly.

## What we collect (and why)

We use **Google Analytics** to understand how visitors use the site, things like which pages are popular, how long people stay, and what devices are being used. This helps us improve your experience, from making search faster to highlighting the recipes you're most likely to enjoy.

This data is **anonymised**. We don’t collect personal information like your name, address, or email unless you contact us directly. We **don’t share** your data with anyone. No third-party marketers. No weird surprises.

## Keeping it simple

We don’t run ads, require sign-ups, or track you across other websites. This project is about **sharing great recipes**, not gathering information.

## Your choice
