Welcome to the **Gousto Recipe Search**, your go-to destination for exploring the wonderful world of Gousto recipes! Whether you're a seasoned home chef, a busy parent looking for quick meal ideas, or just someone in search of fresh culinary inspiration, this site is here to make your recipe browsing faster, easier, and a lot more enjoyable.

## What is this?  

This site is designed to bring Gousto's incredible library of recipes into a clean, searchable, and user-friendly space. Gousto is known for its variety and creativity in the kitchen, but sometimes it can be a challenge to track down exactly what you're in the mood for. That's where this site comes in.

Thousands of recipes organised into an easy-to-browse collection, letting you search by title, ingredients, categories, cuisines, or just scroll through until something tasty catches your eye.

## Why we built it  

The idea for this project came from a simple frustration: wanting a better, quicker way to explore Gousto's recipes. The official site is fantastic for ordering your meal boxes, but not always ideal if you just want to browse ideas, check ingredients, or plan ahead.

So, with a little help from modern web technologies (and some assistance from AI), this site was born. It's lightweight, fast, and built purely for the love of good food and clean design.

## What you can do here  

- üîç **Search instantly:** Type in a keyword, ingredient, or tag to quickly narrow down recipes.  
- üìö **Browse thousands of recipes:** From comforting classics to bold new dishes, you'll find it all here.  
- üì∏ **Visual discovery:** Scroll through recipe cards with photos, descriptions, and tags to spark your next meal idea.  
- ‚ö° **Fast, clean, and simple:** No sign-ups, no fuss. Just recipes, ready when you are.
