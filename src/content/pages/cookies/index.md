Just like the baked kind, **cookies** on this website are here to make your experience better, though these ones are small text files, not warm treats from the oven.

## How they're used

When you browse this site, cookies help us **track what pages you visit**, how long you spend reading recipes, and what types of meals you’re most interested in. We use **Google Analytics** for this, which gives us a better understanding of what keeps you coming back for seconds.

Don't worry, this information is **completely anonymised**, so we can’t identify you personally. And just like we wouldn’t share your secret family recipes, we **never share your data with third parties**.

## Controlling cookies

Prefer your digital pantry clean? You can **delete or block cookies** anytime via your browser’s help settings. Just note that refusing cookies might make some parts of the site behave a little strangely, kind of like baking without flour.

So while these cookies won’t satisfy your sweet tooth, they do help serve up a smoother, more personalized browsing experience.
